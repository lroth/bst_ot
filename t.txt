Calculations:

Hopefully these are simple, but still detailed enough for the tool to work convincingly.

How much do you have saved in a private pension/isa = [value entered] x (1.05)^(retirement age – current age)
Average monthly payments into those private pension plans = ([value entered] x 12) x ((1.05^(retirement age – current age)-1)/0.05)

The values produced by these calculations would then be added together, and the income they produce each year in retirement would be this total multiplied by 0.05

So in the example sent through:

Existing: £60,000 x (1.05)^25 = £203,181
Regular: £3600 x ((1.05^25-1)/0.05) = £171,817
Total: £203,181 + £171,817 = £374,998
Retirement Income: £374,999 x 0.05 = £18,749 per annum

To keep the occupational pension calculation simple you could just assume their career starts at age 30, and the person builds up entitlement to 1/80th of their salary at retirement for every year past this which they work. So, assuming we know an estimate for salary at retirement, you just multiply that figure by: [salary at retirement] x ((age at retirement-30)/80)

So, if salary at retirement was £100,000, at age 67: £100,000 x (67-30)/80 = £46,250.
