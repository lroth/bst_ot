My feedback is as follows:

=== done
[+] Please add ? after all fields that are a question
[+] 'The output of [Name] Retirement Income Results:' Please have this text above the graph. And don’t make the name in yellow as you can’t read it!
>> yellow was taken from the original design.
[+] Rename ‘Age’ to ‘Current age’
[+] Add a field underneath this of ‘Age career started’ (but you can make this un editable at 30 for the moment)
[+] Please move ‘Total Retirement Income’ to above the yellow box and change it to ‘Total annual retirement income’
[+] Total career earnings still isn’t calculated being calculated at all
[+] If retirement income is higher than ‘Desired annual retirement’ income you lose the dotted line. Please make the dotted line visable whatever the retirement income
[+] Some weird things are happening with the graph. See the below when call C is £5000 but if you put in £50,000 is seems to work. Very odd. Obviously the calculations are wrong somewhere.
>> calculations was fine but the higher limit of the chart was taken from the "salary at retirement" so in the case when the salary was about 6k and the desired income was ie. 30000 it wasn't fit the graph - fixed now.
[+] Make the default for all fields unentered / 0%
[+] I really don’t like the way cell E ‘Planned Retirement age’ doesn’t move the retirement age line across on the graph from left to right / right to lefty it just changes the figures. (Please let me know if this causes a problem)

- For all the fields that relate to money please add £ sign before the amounts
>> results already contain the pound marker, inputs?
- Cells C and D do not update the graph or figures at all still??? Please use the calculations provided
>> the formula is wrong - ie. 0,05^(65-40) = 0,05(25) = 2.980232238769539e-33 = "0.000000000000000000000000000000002980232238769539"
